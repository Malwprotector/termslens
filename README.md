# TermsLens Documentation

## Introduction
Termslens is a python-based software application based on a powerful algorithm capable of analysing dubious general terms and conditions of use and extracting, using a large volume of training data, any suspicious content that could affect the user's privacy and anonymty.

## Installing and running
---
<i>Note: I haven't had time to compile my software yet. If you just want to get it working, you will need to check that [python3](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your computer, that the [modules mentioned below](https://github.com/Malwprotector/termslens/blob/main/README.md#requirements) are also installed, then download the files from the github repository to your computer, then run the `termslens_gui.py` file. (The `data.csv` and `interface.kv` file must be in the same directory as `termslens_gui.py` for this to work)</i>

### Graphical User Interface (`termslens_gui.py`)

Launch the graphical interface by executing:

```bash
python termslens_gui.py
```
or

```bash
python3 termslens_gui.py
```

The interface will provide options to perform operations like selecting a PDF file for analysis, classifying text, and testing the algorithm.

### Interface Usage
![inteface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malwprotector/termslens/main/img/ilu2.png)

- **Select PDF file**: Opens a file manager to choose a PDF document for analysis.
- **Classify Text**: Analyzes the provided text in the horizontal bar below the buttons to determine its suspicious nature.
- **Test Algorithm**: Evaluates and test the algorithm's performance based on the provided dataset.

## how does TermsLens works and how to make it work
---
As a reminder, TermsLens is a Python-based application that serves the purpose of analyzing dubious general terms and conditions of use contracts to identify potentially privacy-concerning content. It comprises two primary modules: `termslens_terminal.py` designed for terminal use and easier comprehension of the algorithm, and `termslens_gui.py` featuring a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience. The `data.csv` file contains the training data that the algorithm uses each time to analyse a file. It must always be in the same directory as the python file you are running. This training data will probably be updated regularly to improve the algorithm, so be sure to come and have a look from time to time!

### Requirements

TermsLens utilizes several Python libraries that need to be installed:

- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`
- `PyPDF2`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `kivy`
- `kivymd`

Install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib wordcloud PyPDF2 pandas numpy kivy kivymd
```

## File Structure

- `termslens_terminal.py`: Contains the terminal-based version of the application, designed for easy algorithm comprehension.
- `termslens_gui.py`: Includes the graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
- `data.csv`: Contains the training data required for the algorithm.

## Algorithm

<i>I haven't had time to explain in detail how the algorithm works in this section, but I'll be improving it very soon!</i>

TermsLens employs a text analysis algorithm based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bag-of-Words classifiers to identify suspicious content in terms of service contracts using the training data stored in the data.csv file. The process involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and processing messages.
2. **Training**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Classification**: Analyzing input text or PDF files to identify suspicious content based on the trained model.

### Required Libraries

The algorithm utilizes the following libraries:

- `nltk`: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
- `PyPDF2`: For extracting text from PDF files.
- Other standard libraries for general operations.

## Running the Application

### Terminal Version (`termslens_terminal.py`)

Run the terminal-based version of TermsLens using the command:

```bash
python termslens_terminal.py
```
or

```bash
python3 termslens_terminal.py
```

Follow the instructions prompted in the terminal to perform various operations like analyzing text, testing the algorithm, etc.

#### Credits

I'd especially like to thank the authors of [this book](https://www.editions-eyrolles.com/Livre/9782416010941/l-intelligence-artificielle-en-pratique-avec-python), which taught me a lot about how artificial intelligence algorithms work in Python, particularly by providing concrete examples and easy-to-remember formulas. I would have had a lot of trouble building my tool without this book.

Any similarity (especially in the data.csv file, which contains a very large volume of text) with something that exists elsewhere (e.g. licensing terms or something similar) would be an incredible coincidence.

If you have a problem with something, [my contact page is at the bottom of this page.](https://github.com/Malwprotector/termslens/blob/main/README.md#contact-me) I will get back to you as soon as possible.
